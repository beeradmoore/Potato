## What is Potato?

Potato is a command line tool which helps you to keep the development configs and settings of your Mac as a programmer/developer/coder safe in your GitHub that you
can later use to set up a new machine. Also, Potato is fully configurable so you can track anything from your `.vimrc` to all pip packages installed in your system.

## Why GO?

Because it seems exciting to develop something in Golang.

## Installing Potato

Make sure Go is installed in your system.

To install run - `go get github.com/horcrux2301/Potato`

Or you can use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) - `brew install horcrux2301/tap/Potato`

## Using Potato

1. Add a setting

	Run `potato add` to add a new setting to potato.
	Each new setting takes in 4 arguments -
	1. Name of the setting  (eg - pip)
	2. Description of the setting (eg - Keeps track of all the pip3 packages installed)
	3. Command that needs to be executed for the setting (eg - `pip3 freeze`)
	4. Filename in which the settings will be saved (eg - pip3.txt)

4. Update Git Directory

	Potato also needs to know the directory where all the files are to be saved. Run `potato git` to update the directory path. If the directory has git initialized and remote tracking enabled automatic git push to the master will also happen.

Backup of my personal system - [Github Repo](https://github.com/horcrux2301/Potato-Backup)

The `settings.json` file is stored by default as `$HOME/settings.json`.
